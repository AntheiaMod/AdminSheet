# Admin Sheet
The list of Admin System binds focused on better singleplayer experience. 

# About Antheia
Antheia development is ceased because of Project Rewrite, that means some of these codes are not licensed properly so that's why we stopped revealing source code.

Instead, since this script was made by mine so it was safe to reveal the source code so I uploaded it as another repository.

# Dependencies
- [Admin System](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=214630948)

# Note
- This is Left 4 Dead 2 only script. So you need L4D2.
- This script requires Admin System addon otherwise it won't work.

# How to install
Click on Code button on main repository page, Download ZIP, then decompress zip file and paste autoexec.cfg file to your cfg folder (On Windows, it is usually located on `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\cfg`)

# Bind menu
All binds use keypad.

### Menus
`Keypad /` - Teleport menu.
`Keypad *` - L4D Campaign menu.
`Keypad -` - L4D2 Campaign menu.

### Others
Other binds that might be helpful during gameplay.

`Keypad +` - Restarts current chapter(Force fails current chapter, so restart will be counted at the end of campaign), helpful if you're stuck and want to restart immediately.
`Keypad Del` - Disconnects from server. This is useful when you want to quickly leave from game.
